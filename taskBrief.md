## Brief:
"We need you to write a piece of code which given the price of a house
will calculate the LBTT(Stamp duty) due to be paid"

## "You may assume:
  - The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence
  - The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house
  - The buyer does not own any other properties
  - At the end of the purchace the buyer will still only own one house"

## "Expectations":
  - Must compile without errors
  - Must have unit tests which are runnable (IDE or command line)
  - Must have unit tests which pass
  - Must not move too far beyond the spec (UI or ancillary capabilities)

## Stamp duty thresholds: 
  - Up to £125,000          - Zero
  - £125,001 to £250,000    - 2%
  - £250,001 to £925,000    - 5%
  - £925,001 to £1.5 mil    - 10%
  - above £1.5 million      - 12%
